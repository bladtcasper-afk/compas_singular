"""Development only: make the next command import compas_singular afresh.

Rhino keeps ``sys.modules`` between script runs, so after editing ``src`` the
commands would keep running the old code. Every command used to drop the modules
itself (the "bootstrap purge"); now that compas_singular is installed into
Rhino's Python (an editable install, so ``src`` IS the installed package), that
is this command's job, run by hand after an edit.

Safe to run at any time. The only state it drops is the in-memory copy of each
document's session, and the next command reads that back from the document.
