"""Why the symmetry of the drawing was or was not detected. READ-ONLY.

``Symmetry.detect`` answers one bit per element -- match or no match at 1e-6,
with a ``break`` on the first stray point -- so a plate that is symmetric to
the eye and a plate that is not both report ``order 1``. This prints the worst
mismatch DISTANCE for each of the eight elements instead, and names the point
that caused it, which separates the two cases: a deviation of 1e-5 is drawing
precision, a deviation of 3.0 is a genuinely asymmetric input.

Reads exactly what ``CMD_coarse_mesh`` reads -- same layers, same spacing, same
sampler -- so the numbers describe the real solve and not an idealisation.
