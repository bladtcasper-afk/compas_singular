    Parameters
    ----------
    polylines : list[list[[x, y, z]]]
        The traced separatrix network, plus any curve the user drew.
    pa, pb : [x, y, z]
        Where the edge's two ends are NOW.
    scale : float
        The length the two tolerances are expressed in -- the background spacing
        the separatrices were traced at, where that is known. ``0.1 * scale`` is
        how close an end has to be to count as not having moved; ``scale`` is how
        far both ends may be when neither is anchored.
    claimed : set, optional
        Indices already taken by another edge. A polyline is only reused when
        nothing unclaimed fits -- the case where one patch was split in two and
        both halves genuinely lie along one separatrix. Mutated in place.

    Returns
    -------
    list[[x, y, z]] or None
        ``None`` when nothing fits, so the caller keeps the straight chord.
