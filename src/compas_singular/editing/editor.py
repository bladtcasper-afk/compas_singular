    Parameters
    ----------
    mesh : compas_singular.datastructures.QuadMesh
        The mesh to edit. Kept as ``target``; the editing happens on a copy.
    walls : list, optional
        The domain walls, as point lists, closed polylines or
        ``BoundaryLoop`` instances. A boundary vertex that moves is projected
        back onto the nearest one, so nudging the edge of the mesh does not eat
        the outline. Without walls a moved boundary vertex is left where it was
        put.
    work_on_copy : bool, optional
        Edit a copy and leave ``mesh`` untouched until a commit transplants into
        it. Default ``True``; ``False`` edits in place, for a caller that has
        already made its own copy.

    Attributes
    ----------
    target : mesh
        The object handed in. Only a commit writes to it.
    mesh : mesh
        The working copy. Replaced wholesale by every topological operation that
        succeeds, so hold the editor, not the mesh.
    walls : list
        The domain walls as ``BoundaryLoop`` instances.
    last_reason : str
        Why the last operation was refused. Empty when nothing was.
